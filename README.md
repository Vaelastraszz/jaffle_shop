## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to showcase how to use dbt (data build tool) with BigQuery for transforming and modeling raw data into clean, analysis-ready datasets. The Jaffle Shop dataset is a fictional e-commerce dataset used for training and educational purposes.

## Dataset

The Jaffle Shop dataset includes the following tables:
- `raw_customers`: Customer information.
- `raw_orders`: Order details.
- `raw_payments`: Payment transactions.

## Tools and Technologies

- **BigQuery**: A fully-managed, serverless data warehouse that enables scalable analysis over petabytes of data.
- **dbt Cloud**: A cloud-based platform for managing dbt projects, enabling data transformations, testing, and documentation.
